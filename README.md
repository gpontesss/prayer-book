# Russian Orthodox Prayer Book

A Russian Orthodox prayer book based on the [Jordanville edition]. It's only a
Brazilian portuguese translation, for now, (Don't even know why I'm writing this
in English.) but it could well be a repository for multiple languages if happen
to have enough engagement. That way, it's possible to reutilize common utilities
for formatting etc.

Images were obtained from the [Orthodox Arts Journal] project. Since the
repository's license allows for commercial usage, be aware that the [due credit
should be given to the images](image-credit).
